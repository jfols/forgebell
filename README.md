# Deploy your app

There are several options to deploy your app.

## Meteor Deploy (easy)

You can use the free `meteor deploy` service (hosted by Meteor) or your can deploy to your own server.

```sh
meteor deploy <yourapp>.meteor.com
```

Or to your own domain using Meteor deploy by setting the `CNAME` of your domain to `origin.meteor.com`.

## Semi-Manual Deploy (recommended)

We find the use of [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=c7c4c94c1222) with [Meteor Up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up/) to be the simplest and most cost effective hosting solution.
For a more robust database experience give [Compose](https://www.compose.io/mongodb/) a try.

## Manual Deploy (experts only)
